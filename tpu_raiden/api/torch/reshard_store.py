"""Engine-hosted reshard store.

Zero-sidecar hosting: the serving deployment's transfer-rank-0 worker
constructs one ReshardStore per engine. It owns two surfaces for the
engine:

- the framed reshard service (work-unit directory, request-block registry,
  planner, coordinator) in controller-delivery mode — the same wire the
  external controller served, now in-process;
- the dispatch RaidenController the engine's local workers register with;
  the coordinator submits transfer programs over its persistent
  WorkerService channels, and the destination-side receiver-arm relay
  dispatches through it.

Keep the instance alive for the process lifetime; dropping it stops both
surfaces.
